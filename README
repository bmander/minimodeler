minimodeler

The modeler that's not good at anything except teaching me about
rotation matrices and perspective projection. Minimodeler implements
a three orthogonal views and a rotatable perspective view from first
principles without libraries.

It has four views -
Top left: top
Bottom left: front
Bottom right: right
Top right: rotatable

Shift-click to add points.
Click and drag to move points.
Click and drag red point to move camera.
Click and drag upper-right view reorients the camera.

Some keys do stuff -
'f': toggle perspective in rotatable view
'+': increase focal length
'-': decrease focal length
